Description: DynaMO predicts transcription factor (TF) binding sites by
    learning the spatial distribution of epigenomic data with a random forest
    model. In a time-course experiment, DynaMO also predicts the temporal
    binding patterns of TFs at predicted binding sites. DynaMO identifies
    important TFs in a dynamic process.
